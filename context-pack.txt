You are implementing the MCP protocol handler for dynamic context retrieval. 
Focus on security, performance, and backward compatibility. 
Note that authentication is transitioning from Basic to OAuth2/Bearer. 
The implementation needs additional test coverage and audit logging.
Rate limiting is a priority requirement that's currently missing.
